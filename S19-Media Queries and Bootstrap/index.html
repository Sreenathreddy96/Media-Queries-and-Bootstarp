            In 1926, the 22-year-old doctoral student J. Robert Oppenheimer
            grapples with anxiety and homesickness while studying experimental
            quantum physics under Patrick Blackett at the University of
            Cambridge. Oppenheimer clashes with Blackett and leaves him a
            poisoned apple but later retrieves it. Visiting scientist Niels Bohr
            advises Oppenheimer to study theoretical physics at the University
            of GÃ¶ttingen. Oppenheimer completes his PhD and meets scientist
            Isidor Isaac Rabi. They later meet theoretical physicist Werner
            Heisenberg in Switzerland. Wanting to expand quantum physics
            research in the US, Oppenheimer teaches at the University of
            California, Berkeley and the California Institute of Technology. He
            marries Katherine "Kitty" Puening, a biologist and ex-communist, and
            has an intermittent affair with Jean Tatlock, a troubled communist
            psychiatrist who later dies by suicide. When nuclear fission is
            discovered in 1938 after the Germans succeed in splitting the atom,
            Oppenheimer realizes it can be weaponized. In 1942, during World War
            II, US Army Colonel Leslie Groves, the director of the Manhattan
            Project, recruits Oppenheimer as the director of the Los Alamos
            Laboratory to develop an atomic bomb. Oppenheimer fears the German
            nuclear research program, led by Heisenberg, might yield a fission
            bomb for the Nazis. Oppenheimer assembles a team consisting of Rabi,
            Hans Bethe, and Edward Teller, and collaborates with the scientists
            Enrico Fermi, Leo Szilard, and David L. Hill at the University of
            Chicago. Teller's calculations reveal an atomic detonation could
            destroy the world. After consulting with Albert Einstein, and having
            Bethe do his own calculations on the matter, Oppenheimer concludes
            the chances are "near zero". Teller attempts to leave the project
            after his proposal to construct a hydrogen bomb is rejected, but
            Oppenheimer convinces him to stay. After Germany's surrender in
            1945, some scientists question the bomb's relevance. Oppenheimer
            believes it would end the ongoing Pacific War and save lives. The
            Trinity test is successful, and President Harry S. Truman orders the
            atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, resulting in Japan's
            surrender. Though publicly praised, Oppenheimer is guilt-ridden and
            haunted by the destruction and mass fatalities. After Oppenheimer
            expresses his remorse to Truman, the president berates him and
            dismisses his plea to cease further atomic development. As an
            advisor to the United States Atomic Energy Commission (AEC),
            Oppenheimer's stance generates controversy, while Teller's hydrogen
            bomb receives renewed interest amidst the burgeoning Cold War. AEC
            Chairman Lewis Strauss resents Oppenheimer for publicly dismissing
            Strauss's concerns about exporting radioactive isotopes and for
            recommending negotiations with the Soviet Union after the Soviets
            successfully detonate their own bomb. Strauss also believes that
            Oppenheimer denigrated him during a conversation Oppenheimer had
            with Einstein in 1947. In 1954, wanting to eliminate Oppenheimer's
            political influence, Strauss secretly orchestrates a private
            security hearing before a Personnel Security Board concerning the
            renewal of Oppenheimer's Q clearance, during which his loyalty to
            the United States is questioned. However, the hearing is a kangaroo
            court. Oppenheimer's past communist ties are raised and his
            associates' testimony is twisted against him, with Teller's being
            the most damaging. After Kitty delivers an impassioned defense of
            herself and her husband, the board no longer suspects Oppenheimer of
            disloyalty but still revokes his clearance, thereby damaging his
            public image and limiting his influence on American nuclear policy.
            In 1959, during Strauss's Senate confirmation hearing for Secretary
            of Commerce, Hill unexpectedly testifies about Strauss's personal
            motives for engineering Oppenheimer's downfall. Strauss's nomination
            is narrowly voted down, enraging him. In 1963, President Lyndon B.
            Johnson presents Oppenheimer with the Enrico Fermi Award. A
            flashback reveals that Oppenheimer and Einstein's 1947 conversation
            had nothing to do with Strauss. Instead, the two discussed
            Oppenheimer's legacy, and Oppenheimer remorsefully expressed his
            fear that they had indeed started a chain reaction that will destroy
            the world.

            <h2>Theatrical</h2>
            Le Grand Rex in Paris, where Oppenheimer held its world
            premiere Oppenheimer had its world premiere at Le Grand Rex in Paris
            on July 11, 2023,[132] followed by the British premiere at Odeon
            Luxe Leicester Square in London on July 13,[133] and the American
            premiere at AMC Lincoln Square 13 in New York City on July 17.[134]
            Both the London and the New York premieres were affected by the
            SAG-AFTRA strike, as some actors left the London premiere
            early,[133] and Universal Pictures canceled the red carpet event for
            the New York premiere.[134] SAG-AFTRA President Fran Drescher later
            claimed the studios "duped" the guild into accepting a
            twelve-day-extension for negotiations to continue promoting summer
            films like Oppenheimer.[135] Oppenheimer was released theatrically
            on July 21, 2023, by Universal Pictures.[10][136] In addition to
            standard digital cinemas, it was also released in various film
            formats including IMAX 70 mm (30 prints), standard 70 mm (113
            prints) and 35 mm (around 80 prints).[137] The film was released on
            the same day as Barbie, a fantasy comedy film directed by Greta
            Gerwig based on Mattel's Barbie fashion dolls and media franchise,
            and distributed by Warner Bros. Many speculated that the decision by
            Warner Bros. to release Barbie on the same day as Oppenheimer was
            made in order to deplete ticket sales of Oppenheimer as retaliation
            for Nolan releasing the film with Universal.[138] Due to the tonal
            and genre dissonance between the two films, many social media users
            created memes about how the two films appealed to different
            audiences,[139] and how they should be viewed as a double
            feature.[140] The trend was dubbed "Barbenheimer",[141] and was
            described as counterprogramming during a summer of "entertainment
            industry meltdown".[142] Cillian Murphy had endorsed the phenomenon,
            saying "My advice would be for people to go see both, on the same
            day. If they are good films, then that's cinema's gain."[143] In
            March 2022, Universal Pictures halted the release of its titles in
            Russia, joining other major American film distributors in the
            boycott against the country following its invasion of Ukraine in
            February 2022.[144] Oppenheimer had also been banned by Russia's
            Ministry of Culture, which had refused to license screenings of the
            film, stating that it did not meet their goals of "preserving and
            strengthening traditional Russian spiritual values".[145] The film
            was not released in Japan until eight months after its initial
            global release. Variety noted the controversial reputation in Japan
            due to the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. A Universal
            spokesperson said that "plans have not been finalized in all
            markets". American films are often released in Japan a few months
            after the initial theatrical release.[146] In December 2023, the
            independent Japanese film distributor Bitters End announced that it
            would theatrically release the film in 2024, as Universal's
            distributor in Japan Toho-Towa opted not to release it.[147][148]
            The film was later released by Bitters End in Japan on March 29, and
            during its first three days, it was ranked as the country's highest
            grossing foreign film after making 379.3 million yen ($2.5 million)
            at the box office.[149][150]
